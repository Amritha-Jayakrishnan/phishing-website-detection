## 🧠 Overview

Phishing attacks are one of the most prevalent cybersecurity threats, where attackers deceive users into revealing sensitive information through fraudulent websites. This project presents a **machine learning-powered phishing detection system** that analyzes URLs in real time to classify them as:

- ✅ **Legitimate** — Safe to visit
- 🚨 **Phishing** — Malicious / deceptive site

The system combines multiple ML algorithms with an **ensemble voting mechanism** to maximize prediction accuracy and reliability.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 **URL Feature Extraction** — Extracts structural and lexical features from raw URLs
- 🤖 **Multiple ML Models** — Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression, LightGBM
- 🧠 **Ensemble Prediction** — Combines model outputs for a robust final decision
- 📊 **Confidence Score** — Returns a probability score alongside each prediction
- 🌐 **Interactive Streamlit UI** — User-friendly interface for real-time URL analysis
- ⚡ **Real-time Analysis** — Instant predictions with no perceptible delay

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models

| Model               | Type                    | Key Strength                          |
|---------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Random Forest       | Ensemble (Bagging)      | Handles non-linear patterns robustly  |
| XGBoost             | Ensemble (Boosting)     | High performance, handles imbalance   |
| Logistic Regression | Linear Classifier       | Fast, interpretable baseline model    |
| LightGBM            | Gradient Boosting       | Speed-optimized for large datasets    |

### 🏆 Ensemble Strategy

All four models vote on each URL. The final prediction is determined by **weighted soft voting**, where each model contributes a probability score. The combined confidence score reflects overall agreement across models.

---

## 🔬 Feature Extraction

The system extracts the following feature categories from each URL:

| Category           | Features                                                           |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Lexical**        | URL length, number of dots, special characters, digit ratio        |
| **Domain-based**   | Domain age, WHOIS data, IP-based URL, subdomain depth              |
| **Path-based**     | Path length, number of slashes, file extension                     |
| **Security**       | HTTPS presence, SSL certificate validity, redirect count           |
| **Content-based**  | Presence of login forms, external links, favicon mismatch          |
